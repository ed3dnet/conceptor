In the team hierarchy, Jasmine Patel (EMP024), Team Lead for NovaVisual, reports
directly to Thomas Garcia (EMP011), Director of NovaAnalytics, which means there
is no manager level between them. This represents the "missing manager"
situation described in the requirements.

Note: Unit 138 (Team Lead for NovaVisual) reports directly to Unit 119
(NovaAnalytics Group) which is led by Director Thomas Garcia (EMP011), without a
manager in between - this represents our "missing manager" case.
