# Executive Insights Framework \- Conceptor Output Design

## 1\. Organizational Dependencies and Critical Paths

### Hidden Dependencies

- Cross-functional dependencies not visible in org charts  
- Unofficial but essential collaboration patterns  
- Resource sharing across organizational boundaries  
- Project dependencies across different business units

### Critical Personnel and Knowledge Concentration

- Single points of failure in processes and knowledge bases  
- Key personnel who serve as unofficial coordinators  
- Areas of concentrated institutional knowledge  
- Cross-team subject matter experts

### Resource Bottlenecks

- Shared resources creating hidden constraints  
- Teams or individuals operating at or beyond capacity  
- Sequential dependencies creating process bottlenecks  
- Technology and system dependencies

## 2\. Capability Distribution and Coverage

### Redundant Capabilities

- Similar functions performed across multiple units  
- Overlapping technology investments  
- Duplicate process development  
- Redundant skill sets and expertise

### Capability Gaps

- Assumed but missing capabilities  
- Areas of insufficient coverage or expertise  
- Missing links in process chains  
- Unmet dependencies

### Shadow Capabilities

- Unofficial processes filling formal gaps  
- Teams performing work outside their charter  
- Informal support structures  
- Emergency response patterns

## 3\. Information and Decision Flow

### Decision Making Patterns

- Actual vs. formal decision paths  
- Decision bottlenecks and delays  
- Informal influence networks  
- Areas of decision paralysis

### Information Distribution

- Information flow patterns  
- Communication bottlenecks  
- Areas of information loss or distortion  
- Informal communication networks

### Process Reality

- Formal vs. actual process flows  
- Process workarounds and reasons  
- Unofficial optimization patterns  
- Areas of process friction

## 4\. Resource Allocation Reality

### Time and Effort Distribution

- Actual vs. planned time allocation  
- Hidden effort sinks  
- Maintenance vs. development effort  
- Support burden distribution

### Capacity Analysis

- True team and individual capacity  
- Hidden capacity constraints  
- Underutilized resources  
- Overload points

### Cost Structure Reality

- True cost centers vs. accounting view  
- Hidden cost drivers  
- Resource efficiency patterns  
- Investment vs. maintenance costs

## 5\. Organizational Dynamics

### Change Impact Patterns

- Ripple effects of organizational changes  
- Change absorption capacity  
- Resistance points and reasons  
- Change success patterns

### Growth and Scale Points

- Scalability constraints  
- Growth bottlenecks  
- Organizational stress points  
- Capability expansion needs

### Cultural Patterns

- Collaboration patterns  
- Innovation centers
