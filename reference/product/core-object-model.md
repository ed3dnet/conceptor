# Conceptor Core Object Model

## Primary Entities

### Units

Units represent organizational positions or roles that can be filled by employees. A unit can be:

- An individual position (e.g., Senior Engineer, Product Manager)  
- A team structure  
- A management position existing alongside other units within a broader unit

Units exist within larger organizational units and can participate in multiple organizational structures simultaneously. For example, a Senior Engineer unit and an Engineering Manager unit might exist as peer units within the same engineering team unit, with the manager unit having management responsibility for the team unit rather than direct hierarchy over other units. This team unit would then exist within an even larger organizational unit.

### Employees

Employees are distinct from units \- they are the actual people who occupy unit positions. This separation is crucial because:

- Units can exist independent of their current occupants  
- Units represent organizational needs and structures  
- Employees can move between units while maintaining their accumulated relationships and knowledge  
- A single employee might occupy multiple units simultaneously

### Initiatives

Initiatives represent activities, projects, or efforts that cut across the organization. Key characteristics include:

- Can belong to single or multiple units  
- May cross hierarchical boundaries  
- Examples include product launches, process transformations, or marketing campaigns  
- Often reveal actual organizational operations and relationships  
- May span different reporting structures (e.g., between business and technical units)

### Business Capabilities

Business capabilities represent what the organization can do, as distinct from how it does it. Key aspects include:

- Can be formal (explicitly defined) or informal (emerged through practice)  
- May be implemented by multiple units  
- Can have multiple implementations across the organization  
- Map to the overall business strategy  
- May have dependencies on other capabilities

### Relationships

Relationships exist in two fundamental forms that often overlap:

Unit-Level Relationships:

- Formal interfaces between organizational entities  
- Standard operating procedures  
- Reporting structures  
- Regular meeting cadences  
- Formal communication channels

Employee-Level Relationships:

- Personal professional networks  
- Historical collaboration patterns  
- Trust-based interactions  
- Informal communication channels  
- Knowledge sharing pathways

Critically, relationships can:

- Exist simultaneously at both unit and employee levels  
- Transfer with employees as they move between units  
- Create informal capability access  
- Form around specific individuals who become communication hubs  
- Operate outside formal organizational structures

## Key Characteristics

### Relationship Persistence

- Employee relationships persist across unit changes  
- Historical relationships influence current operations  
- Informal relationships can supplement or replace formal channels  
- Relationship strength varies and evolves over time

### Capability Implementation

- Units can have multiple capabilities  
- Capabilities can be implemented by multiple units  
- Implementation can be formal or informal  
- Redundant implementations may exist across the organization

### Organizational Reality

- Formal structures coexist with informal networks  
- Work often flows through both official and unofficial channels  
- Key individuals may become informal coordination points  
- Actual operations may differ from documented processes

## Discovery Implications

The model suggests several key areas for organizational discovery:

- Formal vs informal capability implementations  
- Unit relationships vs employee relationships  
- Cross-hierarchical initiative impacts  
- Informal coordination mechanisms  
- Knowledge and relationship concentrations  
- Actual vs documented work patterns

This understanding of organizational structure emphasizes the importance of discovering rather than imposing organizational patterns, and recognizing both formal and informal mechanisms through which work is accomplished.
