# Conceptor Employee Experience Design

Date: January 27, 2025

## Document Summary

This document outlines the employee interaction design for the Conceptor system, which aims to discover organizational capabilities through structured employee engagement. Key aspects include the use of both voice-based deep dive sessions and quick structured check-ins, methods for question sourcing and data validation, and principles for managing employee effort and data quality. The design emphasizes organic discovery through natural interaction patterns while maintaining robust verification processes. This document is particularly relevant for understanding how Conceptor interfaces with employees to gather high-quality organizational intelligence while minimizing burden and maintaining trust.

## Core Intent

Conceptor's employee interaction system is designed to organically discover organizational capabilities and relationships through structured data collection while minimizing employee burden and maximizing data quality. The system emphasizes natural interaction patterns while maintaining rigorous data validation and verification processes.

## Information Collection Strategy

### Question Sources

1. Generic Business Understanding  
     
   - Universal questions applicable across organizations  
   - Core role and responsibility exploration  
   - Basic cross-functional relationship mapping

   

2. Data-Driven Questions  
     
   - Calendar analysis-based inquiries about meeting patterns  
   - Organizational structure-informed relationship questions  
   - Follow-up questions based on previous responses  
   - Cross-validation questions derived from peer responses

   

3. Progressive Discovery  
     
   - Initial broad questions establish baseline understanding  
   - Subsequent questions become increasingly specific  
   - Dynamic question generation based on emerging patterns  
   - Targeted follow-ups for identified areas of interest

## Interaction Modes

### Deep Dive Sessions

- Voice/interview responses for complex topics  
- 5-8 questions batched per session  
- Monthly or quarterly frequency  
- Focus on detailed explanations and relationships  
- Transcription and analysis pipeline  
- Manager verification for quality assurance

### Quick Check Sessions

- Structured input formats  
- Yes/No questions  
- Scale/gradient responses (0-10, strongly agree to disagree)  
- Multiple choice selections  
- Drag-and-drop ranking  
- Higher frequency but lower time investment  
- Validation and verification focused

## Data Quality Management

### Verification Loops

- Manager review of flagged responses  
- Peer response cross-validation  
- Data consistency checks across sources  
- Automatic anomaly detection  
- Progressive refinement through follow-up questions

### Privacy and Trust

- Clear communication about data usage  
- Explicit privacy boundaries  
- Manager access limitations  
- Focus on capability mapping, not performance evaluation  
- Preservation of psychological safety

## Question Design Principles

### Batching Strategy

- Group similar interaction modes together  
- Avoid modal switching within sessions  
- Align with natural work rhythms  
- Respect cognitive load limitations

### Question Selection Criteria

- Business capability relevance  
- Cross-functional insight potential  
- Verification value  
- Response effort requirements  
- Information density  
- Validation potential

## System Integration

### Data Sources

- Calendar system integration  
- Organizational chart data  
- Previous response history  
- Meeting attendance patterns  
- Cross-functional communication flows

### Output Generation

- Executive insight mapping  
- Business capability documentation  
- Cross-functional dependency identification  
- Resource allocation analysis  
- Process flow documentation

## Context Management

### Value Communication

- Clear articulation of organizational benefits  
- Individual value proposition  
- Transparency about data usage  
- Progress visibility  
- Impact demonstration

### Effort Management

- Session time expectations  
- Response mode clarity  
- Preparation requirements  
- Completion tracking  
- Feedback mechanisms

## Future Considerations

### Testing Requirements

- Modal preference evaluation  
- Session timing optimization  
- Question batch size validation  
- Response quality assessment  
- User experience feedback  
- System effectiveness metrics

### Adaptation Mechanisms

- Response pattern analysis  
- Question effectiveness tracking  
- User feedback incorporation  
- System performance metrics  
- Continuous improvement processes
