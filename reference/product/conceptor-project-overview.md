# Conceptor Project Overview

## Vision

Conceptor is designed to function as a "consulting associate in a box" \- automating and enhancing the traditional role of junior management consultants in mapping and understanding business capabilities across an organization. The system emphasizes organic discovery of business capabilities through existing information signals rather than imposing external frameworks.

## Core Approach

The system discovers business capabilities through multi-modal data collection and analysis, creating interconnected graphs of business functions, relationships, and capabilities. This approach allows for organic emergence of patterns and connections rather than forcing predetermined structures.

## Primary Data Sources and Collection Methods

### Organizational Structure

- Base ingestion of organizational charts  
- Mapping formal reporting relationships and organizational hierarchies  
- Integration with HR systems for role definitions and responsibilities

### Individual Worker Insights

- Conducted through web-based interview sessions  
- Speech-to-text transcription of verbal descriptions  
- Video recording maintained as reference material  
- Manager validation and sign-off process  
- Focus on natural language descriptions of roles and responsibilities

### Cross-functional Analysis

- Calendar analysis for cross-unit meeting patterns  
- Meeting importance qualification through worker and manager feedback  
- Identification of key communicators and influence nodes  
- Documentation of meeting purposes and outcomes  
- Analysis of communication patterns between business units

### Graph-Based Integration

Multiple overlapping graphs are generated and maintained:

- Organizational hierarchy relationships  
- Cross-functional communication patterns  
- Business capability clusters  
- Process flows and handoffs  
- Resource and information flows

## Key Differentiators

- Bottom-up discovery versus top-down imposition  
- Multi-modal data collection and validation  
- Integration of formal and informal organizational structures  
- Emphasis on actual work patterns versus theoretical models  
- Continuous validation through manager feedback loops

## System Components

- Web-based interview capture system  
- Speech-to-text transcription integration  
- Video storage and reference capability  
- Calendar analysis tools  
- Graph database for relationship mapping  
- Validation and feedback interfaces  
- Analysis and visualization tools
