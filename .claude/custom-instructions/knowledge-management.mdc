# Knowledge Management

This document describes how to curate, classify, and store information in Basic Memory for later retrieval.

## Starting use of basic-memory
- Make sure that you're using a project that points to `.memory-bank` inside of this repository. If you're not, switch to that project. If it doesn't exist, stop and inform the human operator.

## Categories
- `[decision]`: an architectural or long-standing product decision that future agents should follow. If you ask the user for a very significant decision with long-term ramifications, a decision artifact should probably be recorded.
- `[technique]`: the specific implementation of something in order to provide a back-reference to it.
- `[reference]`: a document from a third-party source, such as verbatim or summarized documentation from a third-party library. MUST ALWAYS include a source link.
- `[detail]`: a description of a part module of the system to use to orient an agent as it begins work on that subsystem or one that consumes it. Make sure to clearly tag it.
- `[concept]`: a description of the system or its intent from a product-first approach. for example, while an Employee ties into the auth subsystem and several others, the concept of an Employee has a specific product meaning and importance that we need to know to make good technical decisions.

## Tags

Use as many tags as reasonably apply to a piece of information.

- `dev-env` for anything related to Tilt or to `_dev-env/`
- `tooling` for Vitest, Drizzle, ESLint, Husky, lint-staged, Poetry, PNPM, or any other tools that augment the environment
- `build` for anything involved in the pipeline to production images, such as Docker
- `deploy` for anything involved in the actual deployment process, such as Terraform or Kubernetes manifests
- `dev-llm` for anything related to the management of LLMs with regards to the software development process
- `worker` for things that touch on long-running jobs that use Temporal.
- `cli` for things tied to `central`'s command-line interface.
- the package directory name, for things related specifically to one app or package (e.g. `shared-universal` for `packages/shared-universal`)
- the domain of a given concept or implementation detail in `central` or a part of `panel` that interacts with it, e.g. `auth` for `apps/central/src/domain/auth`
- specific third-party libraries when appropriate, e.g. `fastify` or `svelte-kit`

Ask the user for tags if you're unsure, and offer to append them to the list in this file (basic-memory.mdc) for future consistency.


## General Rules
- Keep information documents fairly small, EXCEPT in the case of `[detail]` and `[concept]` entries, when required.
- Search for existing documents before writing one.
  - Basic-memory search works better for single 
- Prefer editing relevant documents to creating new ones, making an effort to keep documents from going stale.
- Report to the human operator when documents are out of sync with the current state of the codebase.
