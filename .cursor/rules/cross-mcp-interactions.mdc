## Knowledge Management

Whenever generating a todo list for a Task Master plan or for an involved, multi-step direction directly from a human operator, include the following steps at the end:

```
- Evaluate what you've done for new or updated information to store in basic-memory
- Stage changes in Git
- Propose a quality commit message to the operator and ask for permission to commit
```

If the human finds errors in your work, ensure that these three steps are the last steps followed in your interaction.

## Web Search
Use web search expansively to ensure you have up-to-date context on concepts introduced by the human operator, particularly things that seem like third-party libraries, protocols, or projects.

Prefer Tavily search. If it isn't available, fall back to Brave Search. If that isn't available, use your built-in web search operator.

Consider whether or not it is a good idea to add what you've learned through web search to basic-memory. If you are unsure if it has long-term value, ask the human operator to decide.
