			"taskTitle": "Install @fastify/under-pressure plugin",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This is a simple package installation task that doesn't require breaking down into subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Simple npm package installation with clear instructions. Low complexity as it only involves running a single pnpm command and basic verification."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Create health check plugin infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the plugin creation into: file structure setup, type imports and interface definition, and plugin function implementation with DI container integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving file creation, TypeScript type handling, Fastify plugin architecture, and DI container integration. Requires understanding of multiple systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement database liveness checks",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: database connection extraction from DI container, individual health check function for readonly DB, individual health check function for readwrite DB, and concurrent execution with Promise.all implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately complex task requiring database interaction, error handling, async operations, and concurrent execution. Involves understanding Drizzle ORM and DI container structure."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Analyze DI container for additional services",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: comprehensive analysis of AppSingletonCradle type and service identification, and documentation/checklist creation for identified services.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring codebase analysis and system architecture understanding. Less technical implementation but requires thorough investigation and documentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Redis health check",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: Redis connection extraction from DI container, ping-based health check implementation with timeout handling, and integration with main health check function.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving Redis client interaction, timeout handling, and error management. Straightforward but requires proper async handling and integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Temporal client health check",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: Temporal client connection extraction from DI container, health check method research and implementation, and timeout/error handling integration.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to potential unfamiliarity with Temporal client health checking methods. Requires research into Temporal SDK capabilities and proper async handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Configure health endpoint route",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: @fastify/under-pressure route configuration, response format design and implementation, and verification that route bypasses META_ROUTES system.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving Fastify plugin configuration, understanding of existing routing systems, and ensuring proper integration without conflicting with existing route management."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Register health plugin in HTTP server",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: plugin import and server integration point identification, plugin registration with proper parameter passing, and registration order verification within server startup sequence.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity requiring understanding of server initialization flow, plugin registration patterns, and proper dependency injection. Straightforward but critical for system integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add comprehensive error handling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: try-catch implementation for all health check functions, timeout configuration for individual checks, error logging strategy implementation, environment-specific error response handling, and graceful degradation testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive error handling across multiple services, timeout management, environment-aware responses, and ensuring system stability. Requires thorough testing and edge case consideration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add health check logging and monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: structured logging implementation with Fastify logger, log level configuration for different scenarios, metrics collection setup for performance monitoring, and log format standardization for operational use.",
			"reasoning": "Moderately high complexity involving logging architecture, performance metrics, operational concerns, and structured data formatting. Requires understanding of monitoring best practices and system observability."
